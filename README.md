# Plotting Time Series Data From Protein Simulations Using Time Curves

## Data Domain  
  This data come from a protein simulation - 4 LK-alpha 14 proteins (shown below) in water (not shown). The size of the proteins (radius of gyration), inter-protein distances, energy and other association parameters have been tracked during the simulation. This data usually fluctuates (a lot) within a range and occasionally jumps to a new state or value. Fluctuations capture the stability of the system and jumps are important to track rare-events in the simulations.
